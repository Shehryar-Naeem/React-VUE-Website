            <p className="calculation_info">you need to know the total number of grade points you have earned and the total number of credit hours you have attempted.The virtual university CGPA also follows the same pattern of calculation.</p>
            <br/>
            <p className="follow_points">Follow the below mentioned steps to calculate the CGPA:</p>
            <br/>
            <p className="step1">step 1.</p><br/>
            <p className="discription_step1">Determine the total number of credit hours you have attempted. For example, after two semesters you might have attempted 24 credit hours. This figure can be found on an official transcript from your school.</p>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <p className="step2">step 2.</p><br/>
            <p className="discription_step2">Determine the total number of grade points you have earned. For example, you might have earned 72 grade points in two semesters. As with the number of credit hours attempted, this figure can be found on your school transcript.</p>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <p className="step3">step 3.</p><br/>
            <p className="discription_step3">Enter the number of grade points earned and credit hours attempted into the CGPA formula: Grade points earned divided by credit hours attempted equals cumulative grade point average. Using the example figures, this would be: 72 grade points earned divided by 24 credit hours attempted equals cumulative grade point average.</p>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <p className="step4">step 4.</p><br/>
            <p className="discription_step4">Enter the number of grade points earned and credit hours attempted into the CGPA formula: Grade points earned divided by credit hours attempted equals cumulative grade point average. Using the example figures, this would be: 72 grade points earned divided by 24 credit hours attempted equals cumulative grade point average.</p>
